# Task - Predict and Run

This task contains three code examples. Showing the most common uses of the input function - reading a string, an int and a float.

Pay close attention to how we concatenate numbers to a string. Run this code, and use it as an example to help you fix the code in the next replit.

## Help! My Code Doesn't Work!

Make sure that you check for the following things:

- You have put the parenthesis after the input command `()`
- You have typed the variable name **exactly** the same (including caps), every time
- There is a variable on the **left** of each assignment
- You have used a single **=** for assignment
- You have used the **+** symbol to concatenate (join).
- All of your indentation is correct.
- You concatenated numbers using `str(number)`
- You remembered to convert the `input` using `int()` or `float()`
